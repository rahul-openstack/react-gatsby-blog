Sustainable software is the difference between happy productive developers and
disheartened developers with less hair and a LinkedIn thread with a recruiter.

The idea of sustainability has been an omnipresent theme throughout my life.  It
really started to take root in high school when I started my first
company [Great Lakes Aquaponics](http://www.greatlakesaquaponics.com) with my
father.  The idea of aquaponics is to create a mini sustainable
eco-system to grow plants and fish at the same time.  Pure harmony.  

> Aquaponics refers to any system that combines conventional aquaculture 
> (raising aquatic animals such as snails, fish, 
> crayfish or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) 
> in a symbiotic environment.
